2D platformer open source code with Quintus engine and physics code for an educational game.

DEMO: http://ghobrialm.byethost12.com
Loads ONLY IN CHROME OR FIREFOX, MUST wait 60 seconds, and MUST refresh browser if loading for the first time.

The source code is provided for anyone who wishes to develop a 2D platformer game using the Quintus engine and is free to use and abuse provided you indicated somewhere that the original content is from The Learning Island 2D template (accreditations).

Consider the Learning Island 2D to be based on the original Full-Featured Platformer game found at http://www.html5quintus.com

All of my original content meets originalty standards.

The source code, player, and some of the picture frame graphics in the underground levels originate from Quintus, special thanks to them. You may use this open source template by downloading the zip file, extracting the zip file, and uploading it to your localhost or server and testing it using Chrome or Firefox. I included the first 2 levels in the open source code but the demo has 17 levels. The demo can be played at http://ghobrialm.byethost12.com. Note that the game only runs in Chrome or Firefox only.

All sound effects, music, levels, and other graphics were created myself as part of the creative development. The physics effects on certain levels and educational theme has also been added. Feel free to download, tweak, and create your own game based on this template.

Feedback is always welcome. E-mail: ghobrialm@hotmail.com
